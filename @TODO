Stars on each card
- # stars = difficulty ?
- stars dissapear one per second?



Later:
Teacher lock/unlock: teacher can lock/unlock per student so that students can just do in class
Social Media login (including SnapChat)


Maybe:
Change difficulty calculation so that it gives problems that are only difficult, not difficult & easy combined
Placement Test
- would probably need to be required, and based on result would only allow students to start at a certain level of difficulty
