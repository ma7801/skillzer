End of skill --> "nice job" page
Local database (SQLite) for star data
Stats page (how many stars earned, skills needing work, etc.)




Reset timer from card to card (see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8126466/javascript-reset-setinterval-back-to-0) for
 idea on this



Later:
Fix no scrolling issue
Upload data to website database
Teacher lock/unlock: teacher can lock/unlock per student so that students can just do in class
Social Media login (including SnapChat)
Vary the notation for multiplication randomly (dot vs. parentheses)


Maybe:
Change difficulty calculation so that it gives problems that are only difficult, not difficult & easy combined
Placement Test
- would probably need to be required, and based on result would only allow students to start at a certain level of difficulty

Done:

Stars on each card
- # stars = difficulty ?
- stars dissapear one per second?
